## Overview

This project provides a simple, cross-platform command-line timer tool written
in Rust.

It offers three modes of operation:

- Stopwatch
- Timer
- Alarm

The main goal of this project is to offer a versatile time-keeping utility that
can be readily integrated into scripts without relying on graphical interfaces
or external dependencies beyond the Rust ecosystem.

## Features

- Intuitive command-line interface
- Stopwatch mode counts time up until Ctrl+C
- Timer mode exits after time has elapsed
- Alarm mode exits at a specified time
- Alarm mode accepts both time and datetime inputs
- Continuously updating display of remaining/elapsed time
- Lightweight single binary with few dependencies
- Cross-platform and easy to build
